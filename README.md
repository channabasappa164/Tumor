1. First_model.ipynb : It trains the model to recognize the tumors by using MRI images. (yes-20240324T042018Z-001.zip and no-20240324T042018Z-001.zip are part of this code)
2. coordinates.ipynb : It gives the boundary of the tumor and radius of the tumor assuming the tumor as sphere.
3. coordinates1.ipynb : It gives the central coordinates of the tumor with respect to the left bottom of the tumor.
4. ConfusionMtx.ipynb : It gives the confusion matrix of the brain tumor.
5. breast_cancer.ipynb : It gives the test accuracy
6. breast_cancer3.ipynb : By taking certain inputs, it has two codes one gives the stage of the cancer and the other gives the kind of cancer (Benign or Malignant tumor)
7. NURSE MOVEMENT-20240324T042317Z-001.zip : Real time prototype of a robot movement and recording vitals from the patients
8. Surgical Robot Simulation.rar : Its the Surgical robot model simulation using RoboDK (the python files given should be used to make it operate on specific region where tumor is present and the .csv files address should be changed in the python code according to your requirements. if you have other .csv you can use them by changing the address part in the python code).
